# Customer-behavior-prediction-model
Payment behavior prediction model: Developed a logistic regression model in Python, which helps to classify customers using their previous payment behavior. Here we are given payments for 5 months divided into five excel sheets, with customer ID some demographic information amount paid and buckets that classify customers into several groups according their payments before after or on due date. Data need to be merged and with the help of several custom functions preprocessed.  This model shows 91% (approx.) accuracy on test data.
